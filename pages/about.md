Walid Bahsoon, the founder of Premier Enviro Solutions, was born in Sierra Leone. 
Being a natural entrepreneur, he helped to run the family cosmetics factory in Freetown since he was 13. 
Walid's engagement with waste management started when he moved to Malaysia.
There he worked at the first ever Waste-to-Energy plant in Southeast Asia. 
He was handling 1,000 tons of municipal solid waste per day, extracting recyclables for sale and conducting research. 
He was investigating methods for drying of organics and fecal sludge to be used as fuel, and strategies for landfill mining to extract metals and plastic.

Having spent eight years in Malaysia, Walid returned to Sierra Leone in 2014. 
This coincided with the start of the Ebola outbreak.
For Walid this was not an unfortunate timing, it was an opportunity to help his country when it needed it most. 
He secured a procurement contract with the government for delivery of 50 ambulances from Belgium and Dubai by air. 
These were delivered promptly, just before the lockdown in November, and contributed to the end of the outbreak a few months later.

Walid realised that he could use his waste management experience to improve the environment and the public health in his country. 
He founded Premier Enviro Solutions in October 2017.
To find the solutions most suitable for the local context, Walid looked for waste generation data, only to realise that such data doesn't exist.
Walid needed the data to address waste management challenges, so he reached into his savings account.
He commissioned a waste composition study from the local university in December 2017. 
A month long waste audit revealed the quantity and the characteristics of the waste disposed of in the two main dumpsites in Freetown.
The data showed that Freetown generates 550 tonnes of municipal solid waste per day; only 23.6% of this waste is collected.
With organic content of 66% this waste was not suitable for use as fuel for a Waste-to-Energy plant.

Plastic accounts for 16% of the municipal solid waste, that is 88 tonnes per day in Freetown alone. 
Out of these, 67 tonnes remain uncollected.
Plastic pollution shrink wraps Freetown, cloggs its waterways and drains causing flooding, and releases toxic fumes when burnt.
PET drinks bottles (25%), HDPE and PP (10%) could theoretically be recycled, while the remaining 65% are flexible and low-value plastics that cannot be profitably recycled.
Now armed with the data, Walid embarked on a journey to find a sustainable, eco friendly process that would produce building materials from all this plastic waste.

At that point, Walid met Mohammed, the head of an association of four Youth Slum Communities.
As part of the UN sponsored program these young people were trained to make pavement tiles from plastic waste and sand. 
They were openly burning the plastics which resulted in toxic fumes; and the resulting pavement tiles were inhomogeneous and of low quality.
Mohammed said he couldn't find buyers for these tiles.
Walid agreed to buy all of the tiles they've made, if Mohammed joins him for an R&D project to improve the production process.
They started by buying all types of plastic waste. 
Over several months they've tested various recipes until they created a perfect mix of plastic, sand and gravel. 
The resulting blocks did not deform or melt when exposed to fire.
They sent samples to a local lab to conduct stress testing.
The results showed that the strength of the blocks was nearly twice that of conventional blocks made from concrete; Walid was satisfied.
This was the start of the Plastic 2 Build project.

The new mayor of Freetown, elected in August 2018, invited Walid to join the "Sanitation Work Planning" working group, which along with working groups for urban planning, housing and job creation for youth forms the "Transform Freetown" initiative.
This allows Walid to set the direction for waste management and recycling projects in Freetown, including the improvements and extensions to the local dumpsites.
Walid is also working closely with the national government to create an enabling environment for all existing and future businesses in the recycling industry.
Taking the inspiration from the Green Public Procurement scheme introduced in the European Union, Walid envisions a resource-efficient economy with an ecosystem where recycling companies can thrive.
He is working towards introducing incentives and policies that attract investment and encourage the use of products made from local recycled materials.

Already Plastic 2 Build project earned Premier Enviro Solutions an award at the Asia Pacific Housing Innovation Awards in September 2019. 
This was followed by the People's Choice Award at the launch event of the UNDP Accelerator Lab in October 2019 where innovations in waste management, affordable housing, provision of safe clean drinking water, renewable energy, information technology and fashion were showcased.
Walid's ambition is to scale Plastic 2 Build project to use 25% of plastic waste generated in Freetown. 
The benefits will be not only affordable housing, schools, hospitals and public buildings, but also extended lives of the dumpsites, unclogged drainage systems, cleaner beaches and less air pollution from open burning of waste.
Walid's vision goes beyond plastic.
At Premier Enviro Solutions he is also developing projects for treatment of fecal sludge and medical waste, the two types of waste that pose the most danger to public health.
