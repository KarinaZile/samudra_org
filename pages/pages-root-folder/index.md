# Samudra is a system accelerator. 
### If you've never heard of system accelerators before, that's because we invented the term. We did because there was no template for a goal-based organisation that we could follow.

Similar to how a startup accelerator works with startups to turn them into successful companies, a system accelerator works with success-relevant stakeholders to turn a dysfunctional/nonexistent system into a functional one.
