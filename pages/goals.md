10% of global emissions are related to waste, and these 10% get the least attention, so there are many low hanging fruits. 1 in 3 people globally don't have access to waste collection services. Most of them live in Asia, the most densely populated continent, and Africa, the youngest continent and hence most likely to experience population growth. These facts inspired Samudra's first goal - creating waste management systems in parts of Asia and Africa which lack waste collection services. -->
