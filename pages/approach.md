We don't fit into buckets
<!-- not within which bucket we can do most
We believe that a goal-based organisation is well suited for achieving fast progress on global challenges like climate change, environmental degradation and health. 
 -->

Success-relevant stakeholders



Not needing to stay relevant
<!-- Nobody at Samudra likes the idea of a stable job; we want to achieve the goals, know that we've made an impact, and be free to embark on the next adventure. -->

Avoiding the question who'll pay for it


Samudra is not a for-profit organisation - we don't have a product, a service or a business model. 
<!-- Unlike for-purpose organisations, a goal-based organisation sets itself a very specific goal(s) that can be achieved in less than 5 years. -->


Clearly defined goals
